            <p>Your appointments and time are very important to me and are reserved
              especially for you. I completely understand that there are unexpected
              things that can come up in life. If you need to reschedule or cancel an
              appointment, I simply ask that you do so at least 24 hours before your
              scheduled appointment. I ask for a deposit upon booking to secure your spot within the schedule. I am by appointment only and if you do not cancel or re-schedule at least 24 hours before your scheduled appointment you will lose your deposit.

              Please understand that when you fail to reschedule or cancel your
              appointment without giving me enough notice that I miss the opportunity to
              schedule that time towards another client. Please understand it is your
              responsibility to remember your appointment dates and times.</p>
