            forms needed and to settle in. New clients please arrive 5 minutes before
            your appointment as you will be required to complete a variety of forms,
            this will ensure safe and optimal treatments. All forms and records are

          <h2>Arriving Late</h2>
          <p>Arriving to your treatment late may result in a shorter treatment time. This is necessary in order for me
            to stay on schedule and accommodate my next scheduled appointment. Shortened appointments will not result in
            a lowered price for your treatment.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are 15 minutes late to your appointment then you will lose your deposit and the appointment will be

          <h2>Reschedule/Cancel/No Show Appointment</h2>
          <p>Your appointments and time are very important to me and are reserved
            especially for you. I completely understand that there are unexpected
            things that can come up in life. If you need to reschedule or cancel an
            appointment, I simply ask that you do so at least 24 hours before your
            scheduled appointment. I ask for a deposit upon booking to secure your spot within the schedule. I am by
            appointment only and if you do not cancel or re-schedule at least 24 hours before your scheduled appointment
            you will lose your deposit. <strong>If you do give us a 24hr notice to cancel we will reschedule your
              appointment for another date that will work for you and transfer over your existing deposit. Please note
              that all deposits are non-refundable.</strong>

          <p>
            Please understand that when you fail to reschedule or cancel your
            appointment without giving me enough notice that I miss the opportunity to
            schedule that time towards another client. Please understand it is your
            responsibility to remember your appointment dates and times.</p>

            any kind of contagious viral or bacterial infection. Coming into Skin With Love Studio when you are unwell
            puts myself and other clients at risk of exposure to also getting infected. Please remember that I have the
            right to respectfully refuse performing a treatment until youâ€™ve recovered.
